# Pay and Go Evening Parking
# The parking software system being developed is different from
# other traditional parking systems in that drivers donâ€™t need to put a ticket 
# on their dash, all they need to do is provide their license plate number in conjunction
# with a credit card  number. There are two types of users who can use the program. 
# The driver user who can register the vehicle when entering the parking lot. The administrator
# user who can verify that a vehicle is in the lot, removing a vehicle from the lot, clear the lot,
# display all vehicles and charges. The administrator should enter a valid password (assume it is password)
# to access the administration functionalities. 
# Program uses two parallel lists to track license Plates and credit card numbers
